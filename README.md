The Raspberry Pi Pico W Solid State Relay Controller is primarily meant to be
used with an open hardware solid state relay PCB that is being co-developed
alongside this project as part of my Dragon Mobile GitHub organization to make
useful hardware with associated firmware and software for the tiny home, van
life and maker communities.
